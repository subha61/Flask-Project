                <p>If you want to achieve success, then you have to go beyond your comfort zone. You won’t get anywhere by doing what you are used to.
                   You need to go beyond what you think you can do in order to see your full potential.</p>
                <p>We achieve our goals by stretching our capabilities and skills in ways we have never imagined.
                   It’s just like what the quote above said, "success are never came from your comfort zones". </p>
                <p>Progress only happens when we try something different.The moment you decide to do
                   something great, you also have to face the fact that you will be bumped out of your comfort zone.Because that is the only way you can do it.</p>
                <p>When in your comfort zone, your brain does not want anything to change. Your needs are met,
                   you have zero stress, and your brain recognizes that the body is surviving. It’s a recipe for steady performance.</p>
                <p>Getting out of your comfort zone from time to time creates just enough good stress to ramp up your <b>focus,
                   creativity, pace, and drive,</b> and it helps you respond to life stress when unexpected things happen.</p>

                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/portfolio/exam.jpg') }}" alt="">
                <p>Exams are a crucial part of education and the source of stress for many students.
                   it is important to approach them with a clear mind and an understanding of how to deal with stressful situations more broadly.In many cases,
                   exam stress is all in the mind, and mental discipline.</p>
                <p><b>Study in conditions similar to your test room.</b></br>There is a phenomenon in psychology called context-dependent memory.
		           It refers to the idea that we are best able to remember things in environments similar to when the information was encoded. </p>
                <p><b>Take notes in class.</b></br>
                   Do not just rely on your memory or your course book. Take your class time seriously by taking notes summarizing what your teacher has said. If you are feeling exam stress, you can review your notes.Review your notes weekly.
                   This will help you learn the material and transfer it to long-term memory. When it comes time for the exam, you'll feel much better prepared.</p>
                <p>Exam success doesn't define you as a person.
	               Everyone copes differently in different situations and there's so much more to your personality than how well you can respond to an exam.</p>
                <p>Once you've done an exam, try to forget about it. There's nothing you can do about it, and worrying won't change your mark.</p>
                <p><b>Get into some good habits</b></br>
                  These habits will help you concentrate as well as reducing stress:</br>
                  Take frequent breaks. Psychologists say we can only concentrate properly for 30-45 minutes. You could use a technique like Pomodoro, that helps you to take regular breaks. When you do take a break make sure you don’t stay at your desk, you could go for a walk or even just make a cup of tea!
                  Eat well. Keep a good blood sugars level to avoid highs and lows of energy, by eating slow-release foods like bread, rice, pasta, fruit and veg. </p>
                <p><b>Drink lots of water.</br>
                  Believe in yourself.</br>
		          If you feel like you are struggling, talk to someone.</b></br></p>

                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/portfolio/healthy.jpg') }}" alt="">
                <p>When you are in the middle of an exam period, or even study leave or revision time, your focus is usually very much on your work.</p>
      <p>It can feel like a waste of valuable study time and effort to spend any time or energy on shopping for food, or cooking, or even sleeping, never mind seeing friends.</p>
      <p>When you are stressed, as is often the case around exams, your body will find it harder to fight off infections, or to manage as normal. You need to give it all the help you can.</p>
	  <p><b>Food and Eating</b></p>
	  <p>To manage your exams, you will need to eat well.</p>
	  <p>Do not be tempted to skip meals, or survive on chips or pizza for a fortnight. Your body and your mind will not thank you for it, and you will find it harder to work. You may even make yourself ill.</p>
	  <p>If you are living with your parents, or in university halls, or have access to a canteen, this may be easier, as someone else is available to cook for you. Even without this, however, there are ways to manage.</p>

	  <p><b>Sleeping</b></p>
	  <p>It is also important that you get enough sleep.</p>
	  <p>Set yourself a time at which you always stop work—9pm is probably late enough for most people—and be rigid about it. That will give you enough time to relax before you want to go to bed.</p>
	  <p>Have a bath, go and visit friends, read or watch television or check your social media, whatever you like to do, but make sure that you have time to relax and unwind a bit, and do something other than working.</p>
	  <p><b>Exercise</b></p>
	  <p>It can be tempting to decide that you have no time to exercise during exam periods.</p>
	  <p>Exercise, however, has proven benefits for brain activity: it gets the blood flowing faster around your body, including your brain.</br>
         Some scientists suggest that if you are going to do only one thing to help avoid dementia, you should exercise.</p>
	  <p><b>During exams, therefore, it is helpful to continue to exercise.</b></p>
	  <p>Try to do at least some exercise each day, even if it is only taking a brisk walk.
         This will not only help your brain and blood flow, but will also give you a break.
	     This is a good thing when you are working hard, and can also wake you up and re-energise you if you are struggling to concentrate.

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/portfolio/balanced-diet.jpg') }}" alt="">
                <p>Your diet, or what you eat, has a huge impact on your general health in both mind and body.
	               But conflicting information is everywhere about what you should eat, and it is hard to work out what’s best for you.</p>
                <p>Our pages on food, diet and nutrition explain some of the advice, and also suggest how you can adopt a healthy, balanced diet that will help you to feel good.</p>
                <p><b>Protein</b></p>
	            <p><b>Protein supplies essential amino acids, the body’s building blocks.</b></p>
	            <p>All the organs, including the skin, are made from protein. Without adequate protein in our diet, we cannot build and replace muscle and repair any damage. We also need protein for our immune systems to work properly.</p>
	            <p>Good sources of protein include animal products (meat, eggs, fish, dairy products) and beans, especially soya.</p>
                <p><b>A Source of Fuel, usually fat or carbohydrate.</b></p>
	            <p>Fats have often been cast as the villains of diet, but it is now clear that some fat is essential in the diet. Many vitamins are fat-soluble, which means that you need to eat fats to obtain them, and you also need fats to provide essential fatty acids.
	               These are used to provide insulation, and protect organs from damage, as well as helping the heart and immune system to function effectively.</p>
	            <p><b>Fat</b></p>
	            <p>Fats are a much more efficient source of fuel than carbohydrate, so you need much less for the same number of calories. The current recommended balance is that fats should supply around 30 to 35% of total calories</p>
	            <p><b>Carbohydrate</b></p>
	            <p>Carbohydrates are not essential for life.
	               They provide a quick and easy boost of energy for the body, but can be manufactured by the body from fats or proteins.</p>
	            <p>Eating sugars, or simple carbohydrates, provides much faster energy release, but can cause problems with mood swings,
                   energy spikes, and sugar ‘rushes’. It is better to eat complex carbohydrates, such as grains and potatoes, as the energy release is more gradual.</p>
	            <p><b>Vitamins and Minerals</b></p>
                <p>Vitamins and Minerals are trace substances found in various foods. There are 13 vitamins which are essential to human life, and they are used to support multiple functions of the body.
	               For example, Vitamin C is essential for producing and maintaining connective tissue, which holds the body together. Shortages of vitamins cause some really horrible diseases,
	               such as scurvy (Vitamin C), rickets (Vitamin D) and spina bifida in newborn babies (folic acid, otherwise known as Vitamin B9).</p>
                <p>If you are eating a reasonably balanced diet, with protein, fat, complex carbohydrates and fibre, especially from fresh fruit and vegetables,
	               you will almost certainly obtain all the vitamins and minerals that you need.</p>

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Stay Cool During The Night</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/portfolio/Sleep.jpg') }}" alt="">
                <p>Although our knowledge of exactly why we sleep is lacking,
	               we do know a lot about the effects of not sleeping, too little sleep and/or low quality sleep.</p>
                <p>Our overall quality of life can be seriously affected by lack of quality sleep and this can heavily
	               influence how we behave and perform, how we feel and even how we look.</p>
                <h3><b>Promoting Good 'Sleep Hygiene'</b></h3>
                <p><b>‘Sleep hygiene’</b> is the term used to describe the environmental and behavioural factors that may
	               affect our ability to fall asleep and gain a good quality of sleep. </p>
                <p>People who suffer from insomnia (inability to sleep or stay asleep) may work hard on their sleep hygiene in an attempt to
	               control the disorder, however, many of us can benefit from good sleep hygiene regardless of whether we suffer from a sleep disorder or not.</p>
                <p><b>•Avoid big meals before bedtime.</b> Although eating a large meal can make us feel tired,
	               it can also make us feel uncomfortable and therefore prevent us from falling asleep or staying asleep.</p>
                <p><b>•	Stick to a routine and make enough time for sleep.</b>  </br>Although everybody is different, most adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep in each 24 hour period.  Try to keep bedtimes and wake-up times consistent and allow enough time for your sleep.
	               If you feel tired in the day then you are possibly not allowing enough time to sleep at night</p>
                <p><b>•	Avoid caffeine and alcohol for a least a couple of hours before bedtime</b></p>
	            <p><b>•	Avoid watching TV, using a computer, tablet or similar device immediately before bed.  </b></p>
	            <p><b>•	Take regular exercise in the daytime, but not close to sleep-time.</b></p>
                <p><b>•	Stay cool during the night.</b></p>
	            <h3><b>Lack of Sleep – Dangers and Concerns</b></h3>
	            <p>You may be aware of the dangers of driving and operating machinery whilst tired, but tiredness and lack of sleep can be dangerous for lots of other reasons.</p>
	            <p><b>•	Generally you are more likely to feel irritable, grumpy and have a shorter temper when tired.</b>  Lack of sleep can make us more emotional, which can have a negative effect on our relationships with others. </p>
	            <p><b>•	Lack of sleep affects our ability to be creative and innovative,</b> and problem-solving and decision making skills are less effective.</p>
                <p><b>•	Lack of sufficient sleep makes us more susceptible to stress,</b> and more likely to suffer from depression and other serious mental health complaints. </p>
	            <p><b>•	People who do not get enough sleep may drink more caffeinated drinks. </b></p>
	            <p><b>From the list above we can clearly see that sleep is a vital function for our health and well-being. We operate best when we are refreshed and rejuvenated after a good night’s sleep.</b></p>

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Exercise is Good For Your Heart</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/portfolio/exercise.jpg') }}" alt="">
                <p>We all know that exercise is important in our daily lives, but we may not know why or what exercise can do for us.</p>
                <p>It’s important to remember that we have evolved from nomadic ancestors who spent all their time moving around in search of food and shelter,
		           travelling large distances on a daily basis. Our bodies are designed and have evolved to be regularly active.</p>
                <p>In the same way that a sports car is designed to go fast, we are designed to move. If the sports car is taken out
		           once a week for a 3 mile round trip through a town centre then it would probably develop engine problems fairly quickly.</p>
                <p>Over time people too develop problems if they sit down all day at a desk or in front of the TV and minimise the amount of exercise they do.</p>
                <p><b>The Benefits of Exercise</b></p>
	            <p><b>•	Exercise increases energy levels.</b>Exercise improves both the strength and the efficiency of your cardiovascular system to get the oxygen and nutrients to your muscles.
	               When your cardiovascular system works better everything seems easier and you have more energy for the fun stuff in life.</p>
                <p><b>•	Exercise improves brain function.</b>Exercise increases blood flow and oxygen levels in the brain. It also encourages the release of the brain chemicals (hormones) that are responsible for the production of cells in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that controls memory and learning.  This, in turn,
	               boosts concentration levels and cognitive ability, and helps reduce the risk of cognitive degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s.</p>
                <p><b>•	Active people tend to sleep better.</b>Physical activity makes you more tired so you’re more ready to sleep. Good quality sleep helps improve overall wellness and can reduce stress. </p>
                <p><b>•	Exercise improves your mood and gives you an improved sense of well-being.</b>Physical activity stimulates the release of endorphins which make you feel better and more relaxed.  These in turn improve your mood and lower your stress levels.</p>
	            <p><b>•	Exercise can help prevent and treat mental illnesses like depression.</b>Physical activity can help you meet people, reduce stress levels,
	               cope with frustration, give you a sense of achievement, and provide some important “me time”, all of which help with depression.</p>
	            <p><b>•	Exercise is good for your heart.</b></p>

                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/portfolio/two-weeks-exam.jpg') }}" alt="">
                <p>Finals week can be the most stressful time for a student, whether in high school, college.</p>
                <p><b>1.	Create your own study guide.</b></p>
                <p>While many teachers provide a study guide, creating your own can help you understand the material better.
	               Outlining the important information you need to learn can be helpful, both in creation and to refer to during your studies.</p>
	            <p><b>2.	Ask questions.</b></p>
                <p>Your professors and TA’s are there to help! Ask them questions regarding the material and the exam so that you’re prepared when exam
                   time arrives.</p>
	            <p><b>3.	Attend the review session.</b></p>
	            <p>Review sessions offer vital information on exam format, what will be on the exam and key concepts you should be focusing
                   your studies on.</p>
	            <p><b>4.	Start early.</b></p>
	            <p>If you always start ahead of schedule, you’ll never be cramming the night before an exam. You’ll almost always perform better in
	               doing so!</p>
	            <p><b>5.	Organize a group study session.</b></p>
	            <p>It can be helpful to study in groups – sometimes. Evaluate whether or not studying with others will be beneficial to the subject
	               as well at your learning process.</p>
                <p><b>7.	Take breaks.</b></p>
	            <p>You won’t be able to memorize or comprehend all the material at once. Balance is key - ensure that you reward learning with break
                   times to recharge and relax.</p>
	            <p><b>9.	Create a study schedule - and follow it.</b></p>
	            <p>Splitting the material into chucks you can actually achieve can be very beneficial. That way, you can keep track of what you’ve
                   accomplished instead of looking at the big picture and getting overwhelmed.</p>
	            <p><b>11.	Study for the style of exam.</b></p>
	            <p>If it’s multiple choice, you’ll need to know definitions and concepts. For essay exams, focus on your understanding of all the
                   concepts presented, with examples in mind.</p>
	            <p><b>16. Teach classmates.</b></p>
	            <p>Learning by teaching is a method that really works! If you work with a study buddy and explain concepts to one another,
	               you're re-learning the material all over again. It's a great way to reinforce what you've learned and help someone in the meantime!</p>
                <p><b>19. Visualize.</b></p>
	            <p>If you're a visual learner, it can help to create mind maps or diagrams to visualize how the concepts you're learning relate to one another.
	               This is especially beneficial when learning concepts that build upon the understanding of one another, like in science courses.</p>
